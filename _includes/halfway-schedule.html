  <dd class="speaker">Yuri Manin, Max Planck Institute for Mathematics
  <dd class="abstract">The most standard description of symmetries of a mathematical structure produces a group. However, when the definition of this structure is motivated by physics, or information theory, etc., the respective symmetry objects might become more sophisticated: quasigroups, loops,  quantum groups, ... In this talk I introduce and study quantum symmetries of very general categorical structures: <em>operads</em>. Its initial motivation were spaces of probability distributions on finite sets.

  <dd class="title">Simultaneous categorical resolutions
  <dd class="speaker">Alexander Kuznetsov, Steklov Mathematical Institute
  <dd class="abstract">It is a classical fact, that for a family of surfaces over a smooth curve with smooth general fiber, if the special fiber has only rational double points as singularities, then after a possible finite base change, one can resolve the singularities of the total space and the special fiber by a common blowup. I will talk about a categorical version of this construction that surprisingly also works in higher dimensions and, if time permits, about its applications.
