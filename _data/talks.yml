  title: Fukaya categories and functoriality in mirror symmetry
  speaker: auroux
  abstract: >
    <p>The general theme of this talk will be functoriality in homological mirror symmetry, i.e. situations where naturally occurring functors between various types of Fukaya categories correspond under mirror symmetry to classical functors (induced by inclusions and projections) between derived categories of coherent sheaves (or matrix factorizations). The running examples will be very affine hypersurfaces on one side of mirror symmetry, and toric Calabi-Yau varieties on the other side. This talk is based on joint work with Abouzaid and Katzarkov, as well as work of Gammage and Jeffs.</p>

  title: Invariant holonomic systems for symmetric spaces
  speaker: stafford
  abstract: >
    <p>Fix a complex reductive Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $V$ be a symmetric space over $\mathfrak{g}$ with ring of differential operators $\mathcal{D}(V)$. A fundamental class of $\mathcal{D}(V)$-modules consists of the <em>admissible modules</em> (these are natural analogues of highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules). In this lecture I will describe the structure of some important admissible modules. In particular, when $V=\mathfrak{g}$ these results reduce to give Harish-Chandra's regularity theorem for $G$-equivariant eigendistributions and imply results of Hotta and Kashiwara on invariant holonomic systems. If I have time I will describe extensions of thes results to the more general polar $\mathfrak{g}$-representations.
    <p>A key technique is relating (the admissible module over) invariant differential operators $\mathcal{D}(V)^G$ on $V$ to (highest weight modules over) Cherednik algebras.
    <p>This research is joint with Bellamy, Levasseur and Nevins.
