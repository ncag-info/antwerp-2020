  title: Fukaya categories and functoriality in mirror symmetry
  speaker: auroux
  abstract: >
    <p>The general theme of this talk will be functoriality in homological mirror symmetry, i.e. situations where naturally occurring functors between various types of Fukaya categories correspond under mirror symmetry to classical functors (induced by inclusions and projections) between derived categories of coherent sheaves (or matrix factorizations). The running examples will be very affine hypersurfaces on one side of mirror symmetry, and toric Calabi-Yau varieties on the other side. This talk is based on joint work with Abouzaid and Katzarkov, as well as work of Gammage and Jeffs.</p>

  title: Invariant holonomic systems for symmetric spaces
  speaker: stafford
  abstract: >
    <p>Fix a complex reductive Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $V$ be a symmetric space over $\mathfrak{g}$ with ring of differential operators $\mathcal{D}(V)$. A fundamental class of $\mathcal{D}(V)$-modules consists of the <em>admissible modules</em> (these are natural analogues of highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules). In this lecture I will describe the structure of some important admissible modules. In particular, when $V=\mathfrak{g}$ these results reduce to give Harish-Chandra's regularity theorem for $G$-equivariant eigendistributions and imply results of Hotta and Kashiwara on invariant holonomic systems. If I have time I will describe extensions of thes results to the more general polar $\mathfrak{g}$-representations.
    <p>A key technique is relating (the admissible module over) invariant differential operators $\mathcal{D}(V)^G$ on $V$ to (highest weight modules over) Cherednik algebras.
    <p>This research is joint with Bellamy, Levasseur and Nevins.

  title: Spherical objects in dimension 2 and 3
  speaker: wemyss
  abstract: >
    <p>I will explain how to classify spherical objects in various settings (Kleinian singularities, 3-fold flops) using simple modules for the corresponding noncommutative resolution. The main result is much more general, and also more surprising: in the null category $\mathcal{C}$, (1) all objects with no negative Ext groups belong to the heart of a bounded t-structure, and (2) the objects with no negative Ext groups, and whose self-Hom is one-dimensional, are precisely the simples.  In fact, we can even classify all bounded t-structures on $\mathcal{C}$. There are various geometric corollaries. The main technique also works for finite dimensional algebras, where in the derived category of a silting discrete algebra, every semibrick complex can be completed to a simple minded collection.  This is all joint work with Wahei Hara.
